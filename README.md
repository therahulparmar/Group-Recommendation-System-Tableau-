# Group-Recommendation-System-Tableau-

The dataset which was been used in this was created by me.

As a user, he/she will have 3 options to filter out the choice i.e. 
1. Ready to Meet
2. Interested Domain
3. City
This applies to both Details and Maps.

In the obtained output, Random Rank will be assigned to the filtered choice. 
Each Domain will have a minimum of 8 entries based on choice.
As a result, one can form a group of 8,6,4,2 based on Rank.

This workbook has 2 ways you can explore
1. By Maps
2. By Details
